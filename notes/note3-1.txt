The note says "My cover was blown. I can't cotinue the mission any longer. I fear my life is in danger as they are all turning against me now. I'm going outside the city to meet Charlie, he's the only one that can save the city. If I don't succeed, you have to send someone else or all will be lost." It appears this note was written by Lilith. I'm not sure who it was addressed to, but I should go talk to Charlie.
