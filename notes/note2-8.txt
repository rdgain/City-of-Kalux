These pesky Officials seem to always be on the lookout if I talk to the wrong person. I should keep in mind that the highlight around someone means they are either friendly (green) or enemies (red). If I talk to enemy characters, the Officials show up and chase me. Bad things happen if they catch me, so I'd better run!
