It's all over the news: "Poor Lilith Joy Wings was found dead late last night just after her shift was due to end. Official Kay Martin, who was amongst the first at the scene, informed us that it was all an unfortunate work accident. She waas a beloved and well known member of our comunity and she will be greatly missed. The good thing is that our brilliant Officials are doing their job perfectly and we are still safe from murderers and vandals. In other news..." This is ridiculous.
