Lilith died last night. Daren, her boyfriend, called me 2 hours after my shift ended and told me something was wrong, she was late. So I went back to work and found her in a pool of her own blood. Before I could even understand what was going on, I got kicked out by security. They said it was an accident. I don't believe it. Lilith wouldn't just 'have an accident'. I'm going to find out what really happened. First stop: the factory.
