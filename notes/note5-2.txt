The Leader killed Lilith. He found out what her mission was and by ending her, he believed that he was fighting for freedom of the people and basic human rights.
Everyone covers the murder as an accident for different purposes, although they are all suspicious and the Officials secretly investigate it themselves, as they can't do it ppublicly because that would mean revealing the rebellion as an official important problem, which would start a civil war. The Officials want to have me killed so I won't find out about the rebellion and their operation will remain a secret.
The Leader gave me an ultimatum: join him and keep his secret or die.
